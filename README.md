# Knowledge Graph Construction Challenge 2026


Knowledge Graph Construction has seen a wide uptake among academics and industry. Previous editions of Knowledge Graph Construction Workshop have focused on either benchmarking the performance of knowledge graph construction implementations or the conformance of the implementations according to the latest RML modules. For this year, the W3C Community Group on Knowledge Graph Construction introduces 3 challenges, which aim to cover the three dimensions of knowledge graph construction of heterogeneous data; i) conformance, ii) performance, and iii) mapping methodology.



## Track 1: Conformance
The set of new specification for the RDF Mapping Language (RML) established by the W3C Community Group on Knowledge Graph Construction provide a set of test-cases for each module:

> [!NOTE]  
> Although the test cases are published on their corresponding websites and available in their GitHub repositories, we recommend downloading them directly from the DOI, as the other resources may be subject to change.

- [RML-Core](http://w3id.org/rml/core/test-cases): https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19049860
- [RML-IO](http://w3id.org/rml/io/test-cases): https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19049774
- [RML-CC](http://w3id.org/rml/cc/test-cases): https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19055451
- [RML-FNML](http://w3id.org/rml/fnml/test-cases): https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19055650
- [RML-LV](http://w3id.org/rml/lv/test-cases): https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19055778

These test-cases are evaluated in this Track of the Challenge to determine their feasibility, correctness, etc. by applying them in implementations. If you find problems with the mappings, output, etc. please report them to the corresponding repository of each module (https://w3id.org/rml/portal).

Through this Track we aim to spark development of  implementations for the new specifications and improve the test-cases. Let us know your problems with the test-cases and we will try to find a solution.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> RML-star is not included in this year’s challenge, as RDF 1.2 has evolved considerably and the specification needs to be adapted to the final recommendation.

## Track 2: Performance

## Track 3: Mapping Methodology

Although RML has become the de facto standard for constructing knowledge graphs from heterogeneous data sources, the design space for defining and executing mappings is far from closed. There remains significant potential to explore alternative approaches to generating knowledge graphs from heterogeneous data, including improvements in automation, optimization, maintainability, and expressiveness.

This challenge track invites participants to push beyond existing approaches and propose novel solutions for knowledge graph generation. Participants may build upon RML and its ecosystem, introduce extensions or optimizations, or depart from RML entirely in favor of new mapping models, languages, automation techniques, or execution strategies. The focus is on innovation in how mappings are defined, generated, and executed, as well as on demonstrating practical benefits such as reusability, maintainability, scalability, or expressiveness.

By encouraging a broad range of approaches, this track aims to foster comparative insights into alternative techniques for knowledge graph construction from heterogeneous data sources.

Submissions may explore different dimensions of innovation, including (but not limited to):

- Mapping language or model design
- Mapping automation or generation
- Reusability and modularization of mappings

### Scenario 1:  Public Procurement Data Space

The first scenario is derived from the Public Procurement Data Space (PPDS). Participants are provided with public procurement notices extracted from the Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) platform in XML format.

The task consists of generating an RDF knowledge graph compliant with a subset of the ePO ontology, which is provided as part of the challenge resources.

To facilitate evaluation and reproducibility, the expected output graph is also provided in Turtle format.

Participants must transform the XML input data into RDF according to the ontology specification so that the generated graph matches the provided reference output.
